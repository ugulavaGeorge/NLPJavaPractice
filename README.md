# A practice university project. 
A main goal - try to implement spelling corrector using the Yahoo! N-gram data set, which is able to perform context-sensetive spelling correction and should be efficient in terms of time used for computation. The plan B - usage of microsoft cognitive services spell check API.
Second goal - try out syntax parsing using StanfordCoreNLP package. I used Stanford tokenizer, POS-tagger to obtain syntax parce trees and visualize them.
